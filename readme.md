# WikiRye
An open source alternative to Wikiwand, designed with the goal of integration of all Wikimedia Foundation projects

This project uses the wikimedia api to procedurally generate a nicer looking alternative to the wikimedia default theme. This can be used to minimise the need for code injection extensions for styling which can often break the styling of wikimedia pages, and also minimises the need for projects such as wikiwand, which are closed source versions.

Written in vue, this project is intended as a learning tool for the author to use ui engines and APIs.
